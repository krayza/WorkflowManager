Challenge "Software Engineer" for EasyMovie


## Installation

I recomment to use a virtual env

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required packages.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

This workflow manager is a CLI using flask commands

```bash
flask

The 3 commands used to manage workflows are
